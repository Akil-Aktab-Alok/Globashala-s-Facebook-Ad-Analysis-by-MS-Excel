## Key Metrics & Insights

1. **Total Amount Spent (INR):**
   - **₹12,088.61** is the total amount spent on Facebook ads during the period analyzed. This expenditure is distributed across various campaigns and audience groups.

2. **Performance by Audience Segments:**
   - **Audience Segments:** The performance metrics are segmented based on different target audiences such as:
     - Educators and Principals (by age group)
     - Students (by age group: 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, etc.)
   - For each group, key metrics like **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** and **Cost per Click (CPC)** are analyzed to assess engagement effectiveness.

3. **Total Reach and Engagement:**
   - The total **reach** of the campaigns is **188,868** users.
   - The total number of **clicks** generated is **12,025**, providing insights into how effectively the ads are engaging the audience.

4. **CTR & CPC by Campaign:**
   - **Campaign Metrics:** Detailed breakdowns of average **CTR** and **CPC** for each campaign, such as:
     - SHU_6 (Educators and Principals)
     - SHU_Students (Canada, India, USA, etc.)
   - These metrics allow for comparison and optimization of the campaigns based on audience interaction.

5. **Geographic Breakdown:**
   - **Geographical Insights:** The analysis provides performance metrics segmented by geographic location, including countries like **Australia**, **Canada**, **India**, **Nigeria**, and others, showing the effectiveness of ad campaigns in different regions.

6. **Age Group Performance:**
   - The dashboard provides a comparison of **clicks** and **impressions** for different **age groups** (13-17, 18-24, etc.) to identify which demographic segments show the most engagement with the ads.

7. **Campaign Frequency vs. CTR:**
   - A visual comparison of the **frequency** of ad impressions (how often the ads are shown to the same user) and **CTR**, which helps assess how well ads are resonating with the audience without causing ad fatigue.

## Conclusion

The **GlobalShala Facebook Ad Analysis Dashboard** is an effective tool for monitoring and analyzing Facebook ad performance across various segments. By understanding key metrics like **CTR**, **CPC**, and **reach**, the dashboard provides actionable insights that can inform the optimization of current and future campaigns.

## **Recommendations**

* **SHU\_Students (UK)** has a high CPC of 7.08\$ and a slightly better CTR of 3.0%. It still lacks strong cost-effectiveness and should be considered for optimization trials.

* **SHU\_Students (Nigeria)** — CTR of 10.7%, CPC ₹0.36

* **SHU3\_ (Students apart from India & US)** - Great balance of CTR and cost.

* **SHU\_Students (USA)**: with a CTR of 6.1% and a moderate CPC of 5.04\$, this campaign shows strong engagement despite a slightly higher cost.

Overall, I recommend discontinuing Campaign 3 - **SHU\_Students(Australia)** from the marketing.
